We 're not likely to forget him . "
I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait .
" Dear me ! " said Holmes , " he seems a quiet , meek-mannered man enough , but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes .
I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person . "
" There 's no doubt about the authenticity , for the name and the date , 1647 , are on the back of the canvas . "
Holmes said little more , but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him , and his eyes were continually fixed upon it during supper .
It was not until later , when Sir Henry had gone to his room , that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts .
He led me back into the banqueting-hall , his bedroom candle in his hand , and he held it up against the time-stained portrait on the wall .
" Do you see anything there ? "
I looked at the broad plumed hat , the curling love-locks , the white lace collar , and the straight , severe face which was framed between them .
It was not a brutal countenance , but it was prim hard , and stern , with a firm-set , thin-lipped mouth , and a coldly intolerant eye .
" Is it like anyone you know ? "
" There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw . "
" Just a suggestion , perhaps .
But wait an instant !
" He stood upon a chair , and , holding up the light in his left hand , he curved his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets .
" Good heavens ! " I cried in amazement .
The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas .
" Ha , you see it now .
My eyes have been trained to examine faces and not their trimmings .
It is the first quality of a criminal investigator that he should see through a disguise . "
" But this is marvellous .
It might be his portrait . "
" Yes , it is an interesting instance of a throwback , which appears to be both physical and spiritual .
A study of family portraits is enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation .
The fellow is a Baskerville - - that is evident . "
" With designs upon the succession . "
" Exactly .
This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our most obvious missing links .
We have him , Watson , we have him , and I dare swear that before to-morrow night he will be fluttering in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies .
A pin , a cork , and a card , and we add him to the Baker Street collection !
" He burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture .
I have not heard him laugh often , and it has always boded ill to somebody .
I was up betimes in the morning , but Holmes was afoot earlier still , for I saw him as I dressed , coming up the drive .
" Yes , we should have a full day to-day , " he remarked , and he rubbed his hands with the joy of action .
" The nets are all in place , and the drag is about to begin .
We 'll know before the day is out whether we have caught our big , leanjawed pike , or whether he has got through the meshes . "
" Have you been on the moor already ? "
" I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death of Selden .
I think I can promise that none of you will be troubled in the matter .
And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright , who would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut , as a dog does at his master 's grave , if I had not set his mind at rest about my safety . "
" What is the next move ? "
" To see Sir Henry .
Ah , here he is ! "
" Good-morning , Holmes , " said the baronet .
" You look like a general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff . "
" That is the exact situation .
Watson was asking for orders . "
" And so do I . "
" Very good .
You are engaged , as I understand , to dine with our friends the Stapletons to-night . "
" I hope that you will come also .
They are very hospitable people , and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you . "
" I fear that Watson and I must go to London . "
" To London ? "
" Yes , I think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture . "
The baronet 's face perceptibly lengthened .
" I hoped that you were going to see me through this business .
The Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone . "
" My dear fellow , you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I tell you .
