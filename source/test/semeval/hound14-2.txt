" Phosphorus , " I said .
" ' Phosphorus !
' I said . "
" A cunning preparation of it , " said Holmes , sniffing at the dead animal .
" There is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent .
We owe you a deep apology , Sir Henry , for having exposed you to this fright .
I was prepared for a hound , but not for such a creature as this .
And the fog gave us little time to receive him . "
" You have saved my life . "
" Having first endangered it .
Are you strong enough to stand ? "
" Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for anything .
So !
Now , if you will help me up .
What do you propose to do ? "
" To leave you here .
You are not fit for further adventures to-night .
If you will wait , one or other of us will go back with you to the Hall . "
He tried to stagger to his feet ; but he was still ghastly pale and trembling in every limb .
We helped him to a rock , where he sat shivering with his face buried in his hands .
" We must leave you now , " said Holmes .
" The rest of our work must be done , and every moment is of importance .
We have our case , and now we only want our man .
" It's a thousand to one against our finding him at the house , " he continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path .
" Those shots must have told him that the game was up . "
" We were some distance off , and this fog may have deadened them . "
" He followed the hound to call him off - - of that you may be certain .
No , no , he's gone by this time !
But we'll search the house and make sure . "
The front door was open , so we rushed in and hurried from room to room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant , who met us in the passage .
There was no light save in the dining-room , but Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored .
No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing .
On the upper floor , however , one of the bedroom doors was locked .
" There's someone in here , " cried Lestrade .
" I can hear a movement .
Open this door ! "
A faint moaning and rustling came from within .
Holmes struck the door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open .
Pistol in hand , we all three rushed into the room .
But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we expected to see .
Instead we were faced by an object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement .
The room had been fashioned into a small museum , and the walls were lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man .
In the centre of this room there was an upright beam , which had been placed at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof .
To this post a figure was tied , so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was that of a man or a woman .
One towel passed round the throat and was secured at the back of the pillar .
Another covered the lower part of the face , and over it two dark eyes - - eyes full of grief and shame and a dreadful questioning - - stared back at us .
In a minute we had torn off the gag , unswathed the bonds , and Mrs . Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us .
As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck .
" The brute ! " cried Holmes .
" Here , Lestrade , your brandy-bottle !
Put her in the chair !
She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion . "
" Mrs . Stapleton sank upon the floor . "
She opened her eyes again .
" Is he safe ? " she asked .
" Has he escaped ? "
" He cannot escape us , madam . "
" No , no , I did not mean my husband .
Sir Henry ?
Is he safe ? "
" Yes . "
" And the hound ? "
" It is dead . "
She gave a long sigh of satisfaction .
" Thank God !
Thank God !
Oh , this villain !
See how he has treated me ! " She shot her arms out from her sleeves , and we saw with horror that they were all mottled with bruises .
" But this is nothing - - nothing !
It is my mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled .
I could endure it all , ill-usage , solitude , a life of deception , everything , as long as I could still cling to the hope that I had his love , but now I know that in this also I have been his dupe and his tool . " She broke into passionate sobbing as she spoke .
" You bear him no good will , madam , " said Holmes .
" Tell us then where we shall find him .
If you have ever aided him in evil , help us now and so atone . "
" There is but one place where he can have fled , " she answered .
" There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire .
It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he might have a refuge .
That is where he would fly . "
The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window .
Holmes held the lamp towards it .
" See , " said he .
" No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire to-night . "
She laughed and clapped her hands .
Her eyes and teeth gleamed with fierce merriment
" He may find his way in , but never out , " she cried .
" How can he see the guiding wands to-night ?
We planted them together , he and I , to mark the pathway through the mire .
Oh , if I could only have plucked them out to-day .
Then indeed you would have had him at your mercy ! "
It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted .
Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house while Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville Hall .
The story of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld from him , but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved .
But the shock of the night's adventures had shattered his nerves , and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of Dr .
Mortimer .
The two of them were destined to travel together round the world before Sir Henry had become once more the hale , hearty man that he had been before he became master of that ill-omened estate .
And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative , in which I have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a manner .
On the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by Mrs . Stapleton to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog .
It helped us to realize the horror of this woman's life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband's track .
We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm , peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog .
From the end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger .
Rank reeds and lush , slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces , while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark , quivering mire , which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet .
Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked , and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths , so grim and purposeful was the clutch in which it held us .
Once only we saw a trace that someone had passed that perilous way before us .
From amid a tuft of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting .
Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it , and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again .
He held an old black boot in the air .
" He held an old black boot in the air . "
" Meyers , Toronto , " was printed on the leather inside .
" It is worth a mud bath , " said he .
" It is our friend Sir Henry's missing boot . "
" Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight . "
" Exactly .
He retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound upon the track .
He fled when he knew the game was up , still clutching it .
And he hurled it away at this point of his flight .
We know at least that he came so far in safety . "
But more than that we were never destined to know , though there was much which we might surmise .
There was no chance of finding footsteps in the mire , for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them , but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them .
But no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes .
If the earth told a true story , then Stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled through the fog upon that last night .
Somewhere in the heart of the great Grimpen Mire , down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in , this cold and cruel-hearted man is forever buried .
Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had hid his savage ally .
A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine .
Beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners , driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp .
In one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined .
" Where the animal had been confined . "
A skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the debris .
" A dog ! " said Holmes .
" By Jove , a curly-haired spaniel .
Poor Mortimer will never see his pet again .
Well , I do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fathomed .
He could hide his hound , but he could not hush its voice , and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear .
On an emergency he could keep the hound in the out-house at Merripit , but it was always a risk , and it was only on the supreme day , which he regarded as the end of all his efforts , that he dared do it .
This paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed .
It was suggested , of course , by the story of the family hell-hound , and by the desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death .
No wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed , even as our friend did , and as we ourselves might have done , when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track .
It was a cunning device , for , apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death , what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it , as many have done , upon the moor ?
I said it in London , Watson , and I say it again now , that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder " - - he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor .
